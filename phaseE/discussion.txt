## Members - the names and JHEDs of the group members who worked on this project

## Modifications - briefly summarize any changes you made to your project after selecting a
domain and list of questions in Phase A (did you change subject domains due to lack of
data? did you replace questions from your original list of 15, or expand the list? did you
pull in an additional data source to enrich the project?)

## Process - an (updated, if necessary) version of process.txt from Phase C, explaining your
data sources and how you cleaned and prepared the data for insertion into your database

## Successes - describe 2-3 technical portions of your project about which you’d like to brag a
little (for example, what was a particularly challenging aspect of writing your database that
you’d like to highlight so the course staff don’t overlook its complexity?)

## Known Issues - a description of places in the implementation of your project, if any, where
you did not fully succeed (are there bugs? are there unimplemented features?)

## Extensions - beyond fixing any known issues mentioned above, what additional functionality
do you most wish you had time to add to your project? Describe at least two new features.
